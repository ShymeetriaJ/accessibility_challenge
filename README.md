1. What accessibility enhancements were the most chanllenging to implement, and why?
The challenging accessibility enhancement to implement for me was the labels and the :focus pseudo-class enhancements. It is quite challenging to figure out where the attributes go and exactly how to
write the code correctly because one keystroke can make the difference with the intended use or goal of the code.

3. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
ARIA attributes improve user experiences in many ways. They are designed to operate with assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen readers provide assistance to individuals who may be
blind or have low vision or reading disibilities. Along with that Aria ensures that semantic information is provided within these technologies to make dynamic web content more accessible because everyone should
have equal access to the world wide web.


5. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
I used the Google Chrome browser to access the web developer tools. From there I used Lighthouse to chech my color contrasting. I used the hover feature in the web developer tools to check the color contrast.
